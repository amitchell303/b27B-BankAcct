# Workshop - Bank Account

In this workshop, you will be implementing a simple bank account application. A user will be able to see their current balance, make deposits and withdrawals, transfer money to another user, and see a log of all transactions they've made in their current session.

## Instructions

Most of the UI has already been written for you. Your job is to complete the missing code as indicated by the `TODO` comments. Most of what you will be writing involves working with Redux Toolkit.

The [Redux Toolkit Documentation](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started) is a great place to reference! Their example code isn't too different from the code you're working with here.

## Extensions

If you're done early, try adding some of the following features:

- Prevent actions that would result in a negative balance.
- Add better form validation and error messages.
- Allow a user to undo their last transaction.
- Use `sessionStorage` to persist the user's balance between refreshes.
- Use Sass to style the application.

## Submission

Please submit a link to your GitHub repository.
